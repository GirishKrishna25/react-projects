#### Color Generator

###### we provide a color as hex input and it generates tints and shades of that color. And to copy those color values we simply click on them.

- external library for conversion of a given color into tints and shades. [values.js](https://github.com/noeldelgado/values.js)

- dependancy first checks the given input is a valid color or not. if it is a valid one, it gives the colors else it spit back the error.

- we handle that error using 'error' state and 'try-catch'.
